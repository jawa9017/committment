      <h1>Wow Jason this is a super cool site how did you make it?</h1>

      <p class="regular">I'm just doing it in html I haven't even set up the css yet I don't know if it's that good yet haha.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="second">
      <p>Ok the css should be set up now I don't know if it's that good though we'll have to see.</p>

      <p>I think I want the text to be bigger</p>

      <p class="better">There we go</p>

      <p class="better"> The white is too hard to read I need a different color</p>

      <p class="colored">Ok that's better</p>

      <p class="best">This font is pretty good</p>

      <h1 class="mainH1">Let's Start Formatting</h1>

      <hr>

      <p class="final">That took me way too long, flex box is not like riding a bike.</p>

      <p class="final">I want to add an aside but I don't know if I'll be able to format it.</p>

      <!-- <aside>
        This is me testing the aside with a lot of text because I want to see how it'd look as a larger paragraph next to a bigger paragraph of normal text.
      </aside> -->

      <p class="final">I can't get the aside to work and frankly I don't remotely feel like it, so now I have to figure out what to add next. I haven't used an image in a while so I'll do that.</p>

      <img src="img/cards.jpg" alt="A picture of knees and a card and it looks really nice">

      <p class="final">Wooaaahhhhh that's really big lets size that down a little.</p>

      <img class="sized" src="img/cards.jpg" alt="A picture of knees and a card and it looks really nice">

      <p class="final">That looks really nice, let's add a gallery.</p>
