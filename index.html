  <body>

    <div class="first">
      <h1>Wow Jason this is a super cool site how did you make it?</h1>

      <p class="regular">I'm just doing it in html I haven't even set up the css yet I don't know if it's that good yet haha.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="second">
      <p>Ok the css should be set up now I don't know if it's that good though we'll have to see.</p>

      <p>I think I want the text to be bigger</p>

      <p class="better">There we go</p>

      <p class="better"> The white is too hard to read I need a different color</p>

      <p class="colored">Ok that's better</p>

      <p class="best">This font is pretty good</p>

      <h1 class="mainH1">Let's Start Formatting</h1>

      <hr>

      <p class="final">That took me way too long, flex box is not like riding a bike.</p>

      <p class="final">I want to add an aside but I don't know if I'll be able to format it.</p>

      <!-- <aside>
        This is me testing the aside with a lot of text because I want to see how it'd look as a larger paragraph next to a bigger paragraph of normal text.
      </aside> -->

      <p class="final">I can't get the aside to work and frankly I don't remotely feel like it, so now I have to figure out what to add next. I haven't used an image in a while so I'll do that.</p>

      <img src="img/cards.jpg" alt="A picture of knees and a card and it looks really nice">

      <p class="final">Wooaaahhhhh that's really big lets size that down a little.</p>

      <img class="sized" src="img/cards.jpg" alt="A picture of knees and a card and it looks really nice">

      <p class="final">That looks really nice, let's add a gallery.</p>

      <div class="gallery"> <!--All of this code was taken from w3schools.com -->
        <a target="_blank" href="img/goodCreek.jpg">
          <img src="img/goodCreek.jpg" alt="Picture of a creek" width="600" height="400">
        </a>
      </div>

      <div class="gallery"> <!--All of this code was taken from w3schools.com -->
        <a target="_blank" href="img/ebStairs.jpg">
          <img src="img/ebStairs.jpg" alt="Picture of a guy standing on a sidewalk" width="600" height="400">
        </a>
      </div>

      <div class="gallery"> <!--All of this code was taken from w3schools.com -->
        <a target="_blank" href="img/blurryRail.jpg">
          <img src="img/blurryRail.jpg" alt="picture of a guy walking in front of a rail by a building" width="600" height="400">
        </a>
      </div>

      <div class="gallery"> <!--All of this code was taken from w3schools.com -->
        <a target="_blank" href="img/cards.jpg">
          <img src="img/cards.jpg" alt="Same pic as before" width="600" height="400">
        </a>
      </div>

      <div class="gallery"> <!--All of this code was taken from w3schools.com -->
        <a target="_blank" href="img/bike.jpg">
          <img src="img/bike.jpg" alt="Picture of a bike laying in some grass" width="600" height="400">
        </a>
      </div>

      <h1 class="mainH1">Oh wow cool pictures Jason!</h1>

      <p class="final">What if</p>

      <h1 class="sideH1">text was over here?</h1>

      <p class="leftFinal">Or over here instead?</p>

      <p class="final">That'd look pretty terrible</p>

    </div>

    <div class="third">

      <p class="final">How about a color switch?</p>

      <h1 class="newH1">What if you put in a new font?</h1>

      <p class="shittyP">Oh man this one's bad haha it looks like a John Green cover.</p>

      <p class="shittyP">Even worse I just realized it's all caps this is rough. I wonder what it looks like in a big paragraph, like if I just kept typing and filling up the screen that way it's just a giant wall of this Where The Wild Things Are ass font like it's a travel vlog or something. I would imagine it's just super overwhelming and unpleasant to read which should be fun to see after I save this and refresh the page to see the new changes I'm putting in right now (the new changes being all of this text).</p>

      <p class="shittyP">That was underwhelmingly fine. This assignment is getting annoyingly meta I wonder if this joke is getting tired yet.</p>

      <h1 class="newH1">You better hope that the other students aren't doing super cool stuff because then you'd have the worst website.</h1>

      <p class="shittyP">The second person being h1 has been super inconsistent so I'm gonna put it to rest for now. And yeah lets hope the others are awful like mine and also that we don't have to do a critique.</p>

      <p class="shittyP">I'm only at like 60 commits I need to pick up the pace</p>

    </div>

    <div class="second">

      <p class="final">I'm going back to the original layout the new one was too grating.</p>

      <p class="final"> I guess the good part of my page is that it's actually stream of consciousness, I mean this is literally what I'm thinking as I'm typing this.</p>

      <h2 class="h2next">Maybe I Should Mess With More CSS</h2>

      <img class="sizedFixed" src="img/walkway.jpg" alt="A picture of the side of an apartment building">

      <p class="final">That picture is supposed to be fixed but it doesn't really work for some reason.</p>

      <p class="final">I'm gonna attempt to make two columns, hopefully it actually works.</p>
